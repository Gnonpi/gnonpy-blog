So, last month I finally decided to move from Hugo to [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).
The main reason for that was my preference of Python over Golang:
I work all day with Python, I make side-projects in it,
I know how to installing cleanly and how to deploy it.
I was really lacking those last two points in Golang
and I've learned now that if dependency management can feel complicated in Python,
it feels worse in Golang.

Why not programming a website from scratch? There's even templates for that
in almost all web frameworks?
Mostly because I do not want to spend much time making the blog working,
I want to have something to quickly share thoughts
(even if I don't write often and should publish more)
all while not having to always worry about my systems up and running.
A static website generator that reads markdown is perfect for me.

However, I want to share and receive feedback.
Last post (4 months ago, I should really write more),
I was thinking about using [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/)
and looking at the possibilities
that the component I chose to use.
It's simple to setup,
one configuration file,
one entry in supervisor and here we go.
So now, dear visitor, you can tell me what are your thoughts.

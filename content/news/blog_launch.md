So, I have been thinking of blogging for about a year now.

I started mingling with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) last year when I started my job.
I chose it because it's easy to configure, 
adding articles as markdown is super easy 
and the fact that it's static make it easy to host.
I'm not 100% close to moving to another tool
but for the moment, it will do.

I had some credit at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
from a Humble Bumble so I decided to use it to host the blog.
I wanted to host it on my Raspberry Pi,
but as I'm really not an expert when it comes to DNS or server\_name,
I chose the easy solution.

I spent few hours configuring Nginx to go with the DNS registration,
and now it should work fine.

The only thing left is to add more content.
I had written some stub of articles when I felt like it,
let's hope I get the time to polish them.
One blocker I need to work on is publishing code on Github.
Most of the time, I start a new project,
create the repo and make the first commits
but I don't want to push,
because the tests are not perfect,
because there are too many todos,
because this part is not 100% done yet.

Well, that should be all for today.
Let's publish that to check that everything work fine.
